# Assignment 1
[[toc]]

## What will I be exploring in these interviews?
Currently, many collectors (for example, of figurines, Pokemon cards, and baseball cards, among others) use social media to find opportunities to purchase items for their collections and connect with other like-minded collectors socially or to trade with them. I would like to build a social media app that is specifically designed for collectors, making searching for specific items and making new friends that share the same interests easier.

## Who am I interviewing?
::: tip INTERVIEWEE A
Interviewee A is 16, female, and a high school junior. She is a casual collector of K-pop photocards and albums and currently uses Instagram and TikTok as her main social media platforms. Through interviewing her, I hope to learn more about how she interacts with and meets other K-pop fans on these platforms. I also hope to get a younger perspective on social media platforms as places to conduct commerce.

::: tip INTERVIEWEE B
Interviewee B is 49, female, and immigrated to the U.S. from China twenty years ago. She is not a collector, but I thought her perspective would be valuable as I'm very interested in making this app accessible to non-native English speakers and non-Americans. Often, collections can be quite niche and collectors might only be able to find what they're looking for sold by people who don't speak the same language or come from the same country. Interviewee B currently uses WeChat and Douyin as her main social media platforms, and I'm interested in what she values about these platforms that have large Chinese userbases. I'm also curious about what she values in a social media platform that might incentivize her to use one in English rather than Mandarin.

## Baseline Interview Questions
### For both participants:
* What social media platforms do you use on a regular basis?
  * Follow-up: how often is a “regular” basis? (i.e. daily, weekly, monthly)
* What time in the day do you normally use social media?
* Can you tell me about a time recently when you used social media? What did you do? How did you feel?
* Can you tell me about a time when you saw something on social media you wanted to buy?
### For Interviewee A:
* What about collecting photocards and buying kpop albums is appealing to you?
* Can you tell me some stories about how you got the photocards you have?
  * Follow-up, if she got them through buying k-pop albums: would you be interested in buying the photocards on their own, or is the album important to the experience?
  * Do you have any specific photocards you want at the moment?
    * If you were to look for those photocards, how would you go about doing so with your current tools?
* How do you interact with your k-pop collection in daily life? Do you post about it anywhere? Do you show your friends?
* Can you tell me a positive experience you had interacting with k-pop content on social media?
* Can you tell me a negative experience you had interacting with k-pop content on social media?
### For Interviewee B:
* Do you use any social media in English?
  * If yes: What social media? How often? Can you describe to me what it looks like when you use English social media?
  * If no: Have you ever considered using social media in English?
* Do you have many friends that do not speak Chinese?
  * If yes: How do you connect with them? Can you tell me about a time where you overcame the language barrier?
  * If no: Do you have an interest in making friends that do not speak Chinese?
    * If yes: What do you think prevents you from doing this?
    * If no: Why?
* How, where, and when do you usually interact with people that do not speak Chinese?
  * Can you tell me a story about a connection you have developed with someone whose native language is not Chinese?

## Reports
### Interviewee A
Interviewee A generally uses Instagram to contact her friends and TikTok for entertainment. She interacts with content relating to her K-pop collection on both platforms, with both platforms' short-form video content (reels for Instagram) exposing her to the collecting communities that already exist on the platforms. For example, she mentioned that on TikTok she frequently sees "packing videos" where collectors who are trading or selling photocards will put them into a toploader (a piece of plastic designed to protect the photocard during shipment) and decorate it, as well as adding freebies such as stickers. She indicated that she would be interested in participating in that kind of community, with her main hang-ups being a fear of being scammed and an unsureness of how to conduct a trading/selling interaction.

Overall, something interesting I noted was that Interviewee A didn't seem that interested in buying photocards for her collection outright, but was more interested in trading for photocards she already had or buying more K-pop albums to try and randomly get the photocard she wanted. She indicated that she wanted to feel the "dopamine rush" of feeling that she got very lucky and that that was a big attractor of buying albums for her. In addition, an interesting anecdote she mentioned was that one of her most memorable photocards came from a trade with her friend in which Interviewee A had to give up a photocard that she really liked in order to get her favorite member of the group. This story was intriguing because she mentioned that this photocard was one of her favorites, but she was split on whether or not she was really happy about the trade ("Did I really win?").
### Interviewee B
Interviewee B largely uses WeChat and Douyin, which both have very large Chinese user bases. She treats WeChat as a means of keeping up with her friends' posts and as a resource to ask for advice from groups of Chinese people. For example, she provided an anecdote where she was scratched by her cat and asked a Chicago Pet Owners' group chat she was in whether she should go to the doctor or whether it wasn't that serious. Overall, she doesn't really use WeChat as a social media, but rather joins many different group chats and stays in them in case she has a question that they could help with. She also mentioned that she uses Douyin because it's in Chinese and many of the creators on the platform are Chinese, which means that her algorithm is better suited to her preferences and the app is easier to understand.

In terms of English social media, she uses LinkedIn to look for work and to communicate with old colleagues in a professional context. She has also used Facebook in the past to post pictures of her children and to keep in contact with friends, but her friends moved to WeChat and so she did as well. To my surprise, she indicated that she did not have any language barrier issues with these websites, but rather that if her friend circle, which is largely Chinese immigrants, moved off these websites, they would have much less use to her. This ran contrary to my expectations, but she said that while using websites in her native language was easier, the much more important factor in whether or not she would use a social media app was whether her friends were on it. I also asked her about whether she had created connections with non-Chinese people since arriving in America, and she said that she didn't really have an interest in that due to cultural differences and lack of common topics of discussion.
### Design Opportunities
* Drawing from my takeaways from Interviewee A, one of the main reasons she would be hesitant to participate in online trading or selling is the fear of getting scammed. However, she did mention that she would be more trusting of other users on the site if they had a lot of "proofs," which means that many other users posted evidence that the items they bought or traded for really arrived. As it is on current social media sites, this is largely informal and user-moderated, and there is no central authority that has the power to punish scammers or recognize responsible users. Thus, one design opportunity might be to implement some sort of **official ratings system** akin to those found on e-commerce sites in order to allow users an official channel to give feedback to others on the platform. This would help reduce the fears of being scammed and allow genuine sellers to have the opportunity to connect with more buyers.
* Interviewee A also mentioned that something else that is holding her back from trading or selling is that she isn't sure what the etiquette is for conducting that kind of interaction. In my own explorations of Instagram buying and selling in particular, I've noticed that the expected etiquette differs both among trading communities (for example, between Pokemon card collectors and Magic the Gathering card collectors) as well as between subcommunities (between fans of different K-pop groups). As such, I imagine a **universal guideline** for what to expect when talking with people on this social media platform would be very helpful, particularly to prevent miscommunication between sellers and buyers. For example, this guideline might include an official frame of reference for how quickly sellers are expected to ship items, or how best to conduct transactions with those with no reviews to avoid getting scammed.
* Interviewee B uses WeChat as sort of an **advice board**, and found the ability to ask like-minded people questions to be a very invaluable resource. I envision that the app that I design might have a similar feature where collectors can post inquiries relating to their collections (for example, if they want help finding a specific card or are wondering how best to store their collections). The format of an advice board can allow collectors to form a community on the app while also avoiding a lot of the content moderation pitfalls of other social media apps. Interviewee A also mentioned that she would be mostly comfortable with talking to strangers on the internet in the context of a business-like transaction, and the more formal and structured nature of an advice board would lend itself to that.
## Raw Notes
### Interviewee A
* Interests: dance (hiphop and ballet), video games (FPS games, gacha games), reading, K-pop/music in general
* Most used social media platforms: Instagram -> post stories, talk with friends. Second most used is TikTok because there are a lot of funny videos. Least used are Snapchat and Discord
  * Snapchat takes too much energy to keep up with, no reason to use Discord because friends don’t use it -> only use for club meetings
    * Main reason people have Snapchat is to keep streaks, it’s weird how people she didn’t know kept friend requesting her
    * Don’t like when people expect you to keep a Snap streak (sending snap at least once a day), too many notifications
  * Instagram = 2 to 3 times a day, 5 to 10 minutes; TikTok = 2 to 3 times a day, sometimes can go up to 1 hour
* Usually use social media after school ends, 3-4pm to decompress
* Story: yesterday, she went on Instagram in the morning because she likes to check if she has notifications from her friends
  * Follow-up: after responding to friends, do you stay on Instagram or leave the app? She leaves the app
  * Follow-up: do you ever use Instagram for entertainment? A: Sometimes/very rarely
* No times when she saw something on social media and she wanted to buy it
* Why does she like to buy albums/photocards?
  * Marketing from the company before the album is released -> judge based on concept photos (i.e. Enhypen’s Dark Blood album, she liked two of the versions based on the concept photos and bought those).
  * Photocard of the member that she likes, but even if she doesn’t the rest of the members are still cute
    * Follow-up: Why buy photocards instead of looking at pictures?
      * Not the same -> nice to put on bag to show off, also nice to hold the photocard physically
* How did you get your favorite photocard?
  * Pulled him from an album - most of them she doesn’t go out of her way to get them, just pulls them from albums
  * Story: went to kpop store in person with friend, pulled friend’s bias, traded in exchange for her own bias BUT not too happy about the trade because the one she pulled was a really good looking one; “did I really win?”
    * Follow-up: If you had the opportunity to trade, would you?
      * Depends -> if the members that she has are just normal photocards, she’ll trade, but if they look really good she won’t
      * Mostly judges based on how good they look, but more partial to bias
* Have you ever seen other people’s photocards on social media?
  * TikTok packing videos
    * Likes those videos because they’re aesthetic, but a lot of the products they use are from places like Temu and Shein
    * Trading is fine, it’s cute because you get to trade with other people
    * Would you ever be interested in making a packing video?
      * Probably, but right now I treasure all of my photocards
      * What would appeal to you about that?
          * The physical aspect of packing and protecting/decorating the photocards
          * The actual recording of the video is not fun, but the packing process seems really cute
* Have you ever had a specific photocard that you really wanted?
  * Enhypen’s latest album, specific Sunghoon PC, he has a candy necklace (she said she would send me a picture)
  * She mostly sees Instagram Reels about this -> “I just pulled the legendary Sunghoon duo!”
  * Would you want to buy the Sunghoon PC by itself, or would you rather buy the album and pull it? Buy the album and pull it, because she wants to brag that she’s very lucky
    * If she bought it and didn’t pull it, she would be willing to trade, or she would buy the album again and try to pull it again
    * Don’t want to buy the PC by itself because of fear of scamming (unless you buy from someone who has a lot of proofs)
    * Also want to feel dopamine rush of actually pulling it
      * Feeling comes from “I got lucky!”
  * If she got the album and pulled the Sunghoon PC, she would tell her friend who likes Sunghoon and then post it on her close friends and be like “ha ha ha ha ha”
  * How would you go about looking for the photocard? “Sunghoon candy photocard” or “Sunghoon photocard” because it’s recent and viral
    * Otherwise, be specific about what he’s wearing
* How do you interact with your kpop collection?
  * Albums gathering dust - some people use for scrapbooking but she’s scared of harming it
  * Photocards, look at them
    * How often? Not very often, probably once every three weeks?
    * Tell me more about showing off photocards on bag
      * Photocard matches charms on bag and it’s cute, but it brings public embarrassment because people are like “Who’s this asian man on your bag? Ohhh my god you like kpop!?”
      * Digging into the public embarrassment thing – some people think the idea of obsessing over “girly” men is weird
      * Didn’t take keychain off bag because of public embarrassment because it doesn’t come from anyone she cares about
* Have you ever talked with someone you didn’t know in person online?
  * If they reached out to you first and she saw they had mutual friends
  * How do you feel about it? (talking to someone she didn't know online)
    * “NO! I would never do that!”
      * Why? Stranger danger, if someone tries to talk to you that’s weird because they’re a stranger and have no reason to talk to you, also introverted
  * How comfortable would you be talking with a stranger to buy a PC or album?
    * General social anxiety, but not like “stranger danger” because it’s kind of like an online store
    * Awkward, how do you start the conversation? What if they ghost you? Overthinking the interaction

### Interviewee B
* WeChat, only to look at what other people posted, not to post material herself
  * About two to three times a week
  * Who do you follow? People she knows/friends
  * Usually use it in the evening, for a few minutes, or if someone sends her something funny
* Douyin in the evening as well, 1-2 hours
  * Usually watch funny videos, cute animals, Olympics ping pong, whatever the algorithm recommends her
* On WeChat, there’s a pets group chat for pet owners in Chicago, and someone posted a cat that was up for adoption, and she was going to adopt it, but it was from someone in China
  * Why did you join this group?
    * Because she’s a pet owner in Chicago and she can ask it for advice (for example, when her cat scratched her she was wondering if she should go get a vaccine just in case)
    * Also to get advice on what are the best vets, which ones are the most worth it for the money
    * This group chat is full of Chinese people
    * She only asks Chinese people for advice because those are the people in her WeChat group chats
      * If she doesn’t care if she’s asking Chinese or Western people for advice, she would just Google it
* Can you tell me more about WeChat group chats?
  * Muted them all and she doesn’t check them, but she stays just in case there is something she needs to ask about
  * For example, looking for housing -> more of a resource than a social thing
  * Group chats to talk to family
  * Example of group chats she doesn’t talk in: College Parents group chat, which her friend added her to and so she left because it was too active, but then she rejoined because it could have been a useful resource
* There are people on Douyin that advertise products, but she doesn’t like watching them so she swipes, and it doesn’t recommend
  * She just doesn’t like buying things or shopping in general
* LinkedIn is the only English social media she uses, to look for work
  * Every day just to look for opportunities
  * Send messages to former colleagues -> usually about looking for work
  * Communicate in English
  * No problems using LinkedIn because she uses it for professional purposes only
* Facebook used a long time ago, to post pictures and videos of kids
  * Why don’t you use it anymore?
    * Her friends aren’t on Facebook anymore, they moved to WeChat
      * WeChat is convenient and easy to use/dummy proof
* Friends that weren’t Chinese were mostly colleagues, and they didn’t talk outside of work.
  * Remote work, so it’s hard to get close with people
  * Previously, had lab mates but they were too young so couldn’t get close
  * No interest in making American friends
    * Why? Culture difference
      * She doesn’t know what they’re talking about (i.e. sports/football) so it’s hard to connect with people/no common topics, so they just make small talk
* Uses Douyin instead of TikTok because it was easier to download, and the content is made by Chinese people whose sense of humor is more suited to her
  * She thinks that in order to get Chinese people on a platform, then you need to get Chinese people on it in the first place to provide content that is catered for them
  * Or you can give them money to sign up to build a user base
