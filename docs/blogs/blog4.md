# Project Pitches - Response to Ben Sheres

Thanks so much for the thoughtful feedback! We definitely did think of Outfinity as being able to expand beyond just an app targeting fast fashion -- we actually did include in our feature brainstorming an idea for people to create challenges with specific items and asking other users how to style them in new and unique ways, which seems to be along the lines of your suggestion. We were also definitely thinking of the challenges aspect as being targeted to a non-fashion-savvy consumer; especially for people who don't normally care about what they wear but might need to make a good impression for a job interview or first date, we envision this feature being really useful as a way to get crowd-sourced fashion advice from people who are maybe more fashionable!

Funnily enough, one of our other initial project ideas was the expiration dates tracker you also suggest. We had the idea of having people take pictures of their grocery hauls and have the app automatically detect their expiration, suggest ways in which to keep them to make them last longer, and suggest recipes based on the earliest expiring ingredients. We ended up going with the fast fashion idea because we thought the implementation of automatic expiration date detection might be a little too difficult to implement, but I thought it was really interesting that our finalized project idea ended up inspiring an app idea that we had initially brainstormed!
