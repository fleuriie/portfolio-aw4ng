# Lecture 15 - The Importance of Transparency
I'd first like to start off by sincerely thanking the course staff and Professor Resner for making this guest lecture happen. It touched on many topics that have bothered me throughout my time at MIT, especially
with regards to what it means to stay true to your values in a world where you're materially rewarded for abandoning them.

For this blog post, I'd like to focus on the idea of abusing the goodwill of others; in lecture, this was briefly brought up with regards to greenwashing and abusing one's status as a PBC. I think this is one of
the major obstacles to aligning one's economic incentives and one's moral incentives. [This](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240202-has-b-corp-certification-turned-into-corporate-greenwashing) really interesting
piece from the BBC emphasizes how B-corp status can heavily depend on self-reported data, where even companies such as Nespresso (which has a business model entirely dependent on getting consumers to subscribe to
buying single-use plastics indefinitely) can obtain the status and parade it around as a reason for consumers to buy from them. Of course, status as a PBC is subject to many more legal restrictions than B-corp status,
but lack of enforcement and [accountability](https://lira.bc.edu/work/sc/006410a0-66d1-4bb8-b49a-00cb51725442), as well as vague conditions for what "public benefit" actually is, can allow companies to abuse this status for marketing purposes as well.

The bad-faith actors abusing these classifications can muddy the waters, confusing consumers who may want to do the right thing and purchase from companies that are truly making a difference in the world. I've noticed
this most prominently in the fashion world, where companies that are ostensibly working against fast fashion in reality use the same opaque production processes and sometimes even the same manufacturers as companies like
SheIn and Temu -- all while charging a higher price to consumers that want to buy more sustainably. It makes it incredibly difficult to decide which company to give one's money to, because it seems that for every purchase
consumers make, they have to essentially do investigative journalism just to make sure that the company does what they say they do.

One of the strategies that genuinely well-meaning companies can adopt to counteract the trend of bad actors coopting values-based language is transparency. To end this post off on a positive note, I'd like to present one company that I think does this really well: Wren, which is a carbon offsetting company. Their [mission statement](https://www.wren.co/charter) is very clear, and they're also transparent about how much they pay their employees (their CEO makes only [$80,000](https://www.wren.co/blog/wren-financial-report-year-five) a year, at least according to their financial statements). There is definitely a lot to be said about carbon offsets, the carbon footprint, and how those ideas offload responsibility for climate change onto individual consumers, but I think Wren is a really good example of how to demonstrate trustworthiness and to align your economic and value-based incentives.
