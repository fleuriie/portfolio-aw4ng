# Lecture 14 - Critique of Matthew Sequeira's Blog

Matthew's summary of several case studies of real-life design failures was really interesting! Something I noticed was that the examples that Matthew gave were all cases in which platforms with an established userbase tried to redesign or rework their user interface in order to simplify it or unify features across different platforms. Snapchat was redesigning their app's interface in order to simplify it, Microsoft was rolling out Windows 8 which was intended to provide a unified user experience, and Yahoo was trying to combine many of the services they already provided.

I think something important we can learn from this is that, especially in the case where users are already used to features being distinct and separate, developers should be very careful with their urge to combine and simplify what is already working. In a way, we can think of this as analogous to the idea that in the initial design process, our concepts shouldn't have any intrinsic dependencies and should stand by themselves. The natural instinct in this case is to combine several concepts into one (for example, combining Sessioning and Authenticating into one SessAuthing concept), just as the developers of Snapchat, Microsoft, and Yahoo wanted to combine several concepts (in Yahoo's case, maybe Newsing, Financing, and Emailing?) into one in order to "simplify" the system.

As such, these case studies serve to remind us as developers that no matter what our instincts are about streamlining our systems, we should always push back on the initial urge to simplify by combining distinct concepts. Not only should we, as Matthew said in his blog, always get very thorough user feedback before implementing large changes to our design, but we should also be skeptical of large-scale design changes that end up making the underlying system more complex.
